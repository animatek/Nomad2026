# Nomad2026

A modern reimplementation of the **Nomad** editor for the **Clavia Nord Modular G1** synthesizer,
built with JUCE/C++ as a cross-platform native application.

## About

The Nord Modular G1 is a legendary modular synthesizer from the late 1990s that is programmed
via a computer editor. The original Nomad editor was written in Java and is no longer compatible
with modern Java runtimes. Nomad2026 aims to bring this editor back to life as a native
application that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux without requiring Java.

## Development Status

- [x] Original editor running and verified
- [x] Technical research and protocol documentation
- [ ] JUCE project setup
- [ ] MIDI SysEx protocol implementation (C++)
- [ ] Patch file parser (C++)
- [ ] Module system and definitions
- [ ] Patch editor UI (canvas, modules, cables)
- [ ] Synth connection manager
- [ ] Knob/parameter control UI
- [ ] Bank/patch management

## Technical Documentation

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for:
- Nord Modular MIDI SysEx protocol (v3.03)
- Patch file format (.pch) specification
- Module system (110+ modules with parameters, connectors, signals)
- PDL2 binary format description language
- Architecture overview of the original editor
